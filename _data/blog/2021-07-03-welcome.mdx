Economics affects many aspects of our lives.

Every day, we make choices. Choices about how much to spend. Whether we should save. Whether we should change jobs.

We use money, and yet most of us don’t even understand how it works. Where does it get its value? Why don’t we just make more of it?

**The economy is an incredibly complex machine with many moving parts, and this gives rise to a variety of ideas and opinions. In all this, it's easy to get lost in the noise.**

I started NeoCapitalist to help organise and simplify this complex machine that is the Economy, explaining economic concepts and ideas in simple, understandable language.

I will delve into economic ideas and current affairs, analysing different arguments and points of view, and using them to explain economic concepts such as inflation, unemployment, and global trade.
